## Setup and Calibration
To set up and calibrate the SO-101 arm, refer to the **README** inside the [`so101_kinematics`](so101_kinematics/) folder.

## Utilities and Kinematics
Inside the [`so101_kinematics`](so101_kinematics/) directory, you’ll also find key scripts:
- `so101_utils.py` – Utility functions for motor setup and movement  
- `so101_forward_kinematics.py` – Forward kinematics computation  
- `so101_inverse_kinematics.py` – Inverse kinematics computation
